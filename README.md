# BMI Calculator Project
This Python project calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's height and weight inputs. After calculating BMI, it classifies the result into standard health categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese, providing meaningful feedback for each category.

---

## Goal
Provide a simple and interactive way to assess an individual's BMI and interpret the result using Python.

## BMI Classification Reference

| Classification    | BMI Range (kg/mÂ²)       |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Severe Thinness   | < 16                    |
| Moderate Thinness | 16 - 17                 |
| Mild Thinness     | 17 - 18.5               |
| Normal            | 18.5 - 25               |
| Overweight        | 25 - 30                 |
| Obese Class I     | 30 - 35                 |
| Obese Class II    | 35 - 40                 |
| Obese Class III   | > 40                    |

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Input your weight in kilograms.
4. Input your height in centimeters.
5. Receive your BMI score and the corresponding health classification.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for metric/imperial unit conversions (e.g., pounds/inches).
- Visualize BMI results with charts or graphs.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction.
- Allow repeated calculations without restarting the program.
